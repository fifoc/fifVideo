What needs to be done:
    - Segment simplification (This would use the color simplification alghoritm to find the nearest one too)
        ( Standard, Text-optimised )
        Standard like in old fif
        Text-optimised like 2 brightest colors (or 2 darkest)

    - Color simplification
        ( Standard, Always step down, Always step up, Stupid, Realistic )

    - Segment encoding strategies
        -> Line
        -> Vertical line
        -> Fill
        -> Line with overwrite
        -> Vertical line with overwrite
        -> Fill with overwrite
        -> All above with inversion allowed

    - Strategy picking:
        -> Sort color by occurence and then for every character try something, pick, mask, try
        -> Try EVERY strategy for EVERY character before taking action
        -> Vertical lines instead of horizontal
        -> Edge based

Afterwards: video!
    - Lossy differences:
        -> Pixel amount (if not enough change, don't do stuff) | Variable frame rate |

    - Difference simplification:
        -> Attempt to draw lines between areas, simplify some detail (remove special color occurences etc)
        -> Attempt to simplify areas into boxes (up to --threshold)

    - Copy opcode
    - Encoder operations to use buffer or direct rendering
    - Audio sync
    - Bandwidth and GPU operation limiting per second/frame

Finally:
    -> lua player capable of handling this
    -> youtube-dl frontend
